# Documentation and System Agent

This is a CLI-based LLM agent capable of answering questions by reading project documentation, exploring source code, and querying the deployed backend API.

## Architecture

- **Language**: Python 3.14
- **LLM Provider**: Qwen Code API
- **Model**: `qwen3-coder-plus`
- **HTTP Client**: `httpx` for API requests

## Agentic Loop and Tools

The agent operates in a loop (maximum 10 iterations) to autonomously gather information before answering:

### Tools

1. **`list_files(path)`**: Lists contents of a directory. Used to discover available documentation (e.g., in the `wiki` folder) or explore source code structure.

2. **`read_file(path)`**: Reads the contents of a specified file. Used to read documentation, source code, or configuration files.

3. **`query_api(method, path, body)`**: Queries the deployed backend API with authentication. Used for:
   - System facts (framework, ports, status codes)
   - Data-dependent queries (item count, scores, analytics)
   - Bug diagnosis through API error responses

**Security note**: The `list_files` and `read_file` tools use `os.path.abspath` to restrict access strictly to the project directory, preventing path traversal attacks (`../`). The `query_api` tool requires the `LMS_API_KEY` for authentication.

### Agentic Loop Flow

```
User Question → LLM (with tools schema)
    ↓
LLM decides: tool call or final answer?
    ↓
If tool call:
    → Execute tool (list_files, read_file, or query_api)
    → Append result as "tool" role message
    → Back to LLM for next iteration
    ↓
If final answer:
    → Parse JSON from LLM response
    → Output: {"answer": "...", "source": "...", "tool_calls": [...]}
```

### Tool Selection Strategy

The system prompt guides the LLM on when to use each tool:

- **Wiki/documentation questions** → `list_files` + `read_file`
- **System facts** (framework, ports) → `query_api` or `read_file` on source code
- **Data queries** (item count, scores) → `query_api` with appropriate endpoint
- **Code questions** → `read_file` on source files

## Environment Variables

The agent reads all configuration from environment variables:

| Variable | Source | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `LLM_API_KEY` | `.env.agent.secret` | LLM provider API key |
| `LLM_API_BASE` | `.env.agent.secret` | LLM API endpoint URL |
| `LLM_MODEL` | `.env.agent.secret` | Model name |
| `LMS_API_KEY` | `.env.docker.secret` | Backend API authentication |
| `AGENT_API_BASE_URL` | Optional (default: `http://localhost:42002`) | Backend base URL |

## Output Format

The agent outputs a single JSON line to stdout:

```json
{
  "answer": "The answer text",
  "source": "wiki/git-workflow.md#resolving-merge-conflicts",
  "tool_calls": [
    {"tool": "list_files", "args": {"path": "wiki"}, "result": "..."},
    {"tool": "read_file", "args": {"path": "wiki/git-workflow.md"}, "result": "..."}
  ]
}
```

- `answer` (required): The final answer
- `source` (optional): File reference for documentation answers; empty string for API-derived answers
- `tool_calls` (required): Array of all tool calls made during execution

## Usage

```bash
# Basic question
uv run agent.py "What is 2+2?"

# Documentation question
uv run agent.py "How do you resolve a merge conflict?"

# System fact question
uv run agent.py "What Python web framework does this project use?"

# Data query question
uv run agent.py "How many items are in the database?"
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Tool descriptions matter**: The LLM relies heavily on tool descriptions to decide which tool to use. Being explicit about when to use `query_api` vs `read_file` improved accuracy significantly.

2. **Error handling is critical**: The `query_api` tool must handle connection errors gracefully since the backend may not always be running. Returning descriptive error messages allows the LLM to explain what went wrong.

3. **Path security**: Using `os.path.abspath` and checking that paths start with `BASE_DIR` prevents directory traversal attacks while still allowing relative paths.

4. **LLM response parsing**: The LLM sometimes returns `null` for `content` when making tool calls. Using `(msg.get("content") or "")` instead of `msg.get("content", "")` handles this edge case.

5. **Iterative testing**: Running `run_eval.py` after each change helped identify which questions failed and why. Most failures were due to the LLM not using the right tool, which was fixed by improving the system prompt.

## Final Evaluation Score

- **Local benchmark**: 5/5 tests passing
- **Tool coverage**: All three tools (`list_files`, `read_file`, `query_api`) are tested
- **Regression tests**: 5 tests covering basic responses, tool usage, and source attribution
